# Enhanced Collision Detection System Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the enhanced collision detection system for the day07_kiro RPG game. The system provides efficient spatial partitioning, multiple collision detection algorithms, and flexible collision response mechanisms.

## Implemented Components

### 1. QuadTree Spatial Partitioning (`rpg/systems/QuadTree.java`)

**Features:**
- Hierarchical spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection
- Dynamic insertion and removal of entities
- Configurable maximum objects per node (10) and maximum levels (5)
- Query functionality to retrieve nearby entities
- Memory-efficient storage with automatic subdivision

**Key Methods:**
- `insert(Entity, Rectangle)` - Add entity to spatial structure
- `retrieve(List<Entity>, Rectangle)` - Get nearby entities
- `clear()` - Reset the tree
- `remove(Entity, Rectangle)` - Remove specific entity

### 2. Collision Detection Algorithms (`rpg/systems/CollisionDetection.java`)

**Implemented Algorithms:**
- **AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)** collision detection
- **Circle-Circle** collision detection
- **Circle-Rectangle** collision detection
- **Point-in-Rectangle** and **Point-in-Circle** tests
- **Line segment intersection** detection
- **Ray-Rectangle intersection** for raycasting
- **Minimum Translation Vector (MTV)** calculation for separation

**Utility Functions:**
- Distance calculations (regular and squared for performance)
- Overlap calculations for X and Y axes
- Rectangle containment tests

### 3. Enhanced Collision System (`rpg/systems/CollisionSystem.java`)

**Improvements:**
- Integrated QuadTree for spatial optimization
- Enhanced collision detection using multiple algorithms
- Improved collision resolution with mass-based separation
- Support for tile collision detection
- Collision event publishing through EventBus
- Performance statistics and debugging support

**Key Features:**
- Broad-phase collision detection using QuadTree
- Narrow-phase collision detection with AABB algorithms
- Collision response with physics-based separation
- Trigger zone support for event-based interactions

### 4. Collision Response System (`rpg/systems/CollisionResponse.java`)

**Response Types:**
- **NONE** - No physical response (for triggers)
- **STOP** - Entities stop on collision
- **BOUNCE** - Realistic bouncing with mass consideration
- **SLIDE** - Sliding along collision surfaces
- **PUSH** - One entity pushes another
- **SEPARATE** - Mass-based entity separation

**Physics Features:**
- Mass-based collision response calculations
- Momentum transfer between entities
- Collision normal calculation for realistic physics

### 5. Collision Layer System (`rpg/systems/CollisionLayer.java`)

**Predefined Layers:**
- DEFAULT, PLAYER, ENEMY, ENVIRONMENT
- PROJECTILE, TRIGGER, PICKUP, WALL
- WATER, PLATFORM

**Features:**
- Layer-based collision filtering
- Customizable collision matrix
- Helper methods for layer type checking
- Debug-friendly layer naming

### 6. Tile Collision Detection (`rpg/systems/TileCollisionDetector.java`)

**Capabilities:**
- Grid-based tile collision detection
- Predictive collision checking before movement
- Collision response calculation for tile interactions
- World boundary checking
- Integration with existing TileManager

**Key Methods:**
- `checkTileCollision(Entity)` - Check current collision state
- `checkTileCollisionWithMovement(Entity, deltaX, deltaY)` - Predictive checking
- `getTileCollisionResponse(Entity, deltaX, deltaY)` - Calculate corrected movement

### 7. Collision Manager (`rpg/systems/CollisionManager.java`)

**High-Level Features:**
- Unified collision management interface
- Configurable collision detection strategies
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Custom collision layer rules
- Integration with event system

**Statistics Tracking:**
- Total entities processed
- Number of entity-entity collisions
- Number of tile collisions
- Processing time measurements

### 8. Event System Integration

**New Events:**
- `CollisionEvent` - Entity-entity collision events (ENTER, STAY, EXIT)
- `TriggerEvent` - Trigger zone interaction events

**Event Publishing:**
- Automatic event generation for collision state changes
- Integration with existing EventBus system
- Support for collision enter/exit detection

## Performance Optimizations

### Spatial Partitioning
- QuadTree reduces collision checks from O(n²) to approximately O(n log n)
- Configurable tree depth and object limits for memory optimization
- Dynamic subdivision only when needed

### Collision Detection
- Early rejection using bounding box tests
- Squared distance calculations to avoid expensive square root operations
- Efficient overlap calculations for separation

### Memory Management
- Object pooling considerations for frequently created collision pairs
- Efficient data structures for collision state tracking
- Minimal memory allocation during collision detection

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **EntityManager**: Uses `getEntitiesWithComponent()` for entity queries
- **EventBus**: Publishes collision and trigger events
- **TileManager**: Integrates with existing tile collision data
- **MovementSystem**: Coordinates with movement for collision response

### Configuration
- Configurable through existing Config system
- Runtime toggles for spatial partitioning and tile collision
- Debug mode for collision visualization

## Usage Examples

### Basic Collision Setup
```java
// Create collision manager
CollisionManager collisionManager = new CollisionManager(worldBounds);
collisionManager.setEventBus(eventBus);
collisionManager.setTileCollisionDetector(tileDetector);

// Update each frame
collisionManager.update(entities, deltaTime);
```

### Entity Collision Configuration
```java
// Create entity with collision
Entity player = entityManager.createEntity();
CollisionComponent collision = new CollisionComponent(32, 32);
collision.setCollisionLayer(CollisionLayer.PLAYER);
collision.setSolid(true);
player.addComponent(collision);
```

### Custom Collision Rules
```java
// Disable collision between specific layers
collisionManager.setLayerCollision(
    CollisionLayer.PLAYER, 
    CollisionLayer.PICKUP, 
    false
);
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`TestCollisionSystem.java`) was created to verify:
- QuadTree insertion, retrieval, and clearing
- Collision detection algorithm accuracy
- Collision manager integration
- Layer collision rule enforcement
