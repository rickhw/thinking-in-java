# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the refactoring requirements for the day07_kiro 2D RPG game project. The current codebase has several architectural and code quality issues that need to be addressed to improve maintainability, performance, and extensibility. The refactoring will focus on applying proper design patterns, improving code organization, enhancing error handling, and establishing better separation of concerns while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want proper separation of concerns and clean architecture, so that the code is easier to understand, modify, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN each class SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
2. WHEN examining class dependencies THEN there SHALL be clear interfaces between different system components
3. WHEN looking at the GamePanel class THEN it SHALL NOT directly manage all game subsystems but delegate to appropriate managers
4. IF a new game feature needs to be added THEN it SHALL be possible without modifying multiple unrelated classes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the entity system, I want a proper component-based architecture, so that entities can be composed of reusable components rather than inheriting everything from a base class.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new entity types THEN they SHALL be composed of components rather than inheriting all functionality
2. WHEN an entity needs movement capability THEN it SHALL use a MovementComponent
3. WHEN an entity needs rendering capability THEN it SHALL use a RenderComponent
4. WHEN an entity needs collision detection THEN it SHALL use a CollisionComponent
5. IF an entity doesn't need certain capabilities THEN it SHALL NOT be forced to inherit unused functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the game loop, I want proper state management and update ordering, so that game systems update in the correct sequence and state changes are predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loop executes THEN systems SHALL update in a defined, consistent order
2. WHEN multiple systems need to modify the same data THEN there SHALL be clear ownership and update rules
3. WHEN the game state changes THEN all dependent systems SHALL be notified appropriately
4. IF a system fails during update THEN it SHALL NOT crash the entire game loop

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the application, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file loading operations occur THEN they SHALL have proper error handling with meaningful error messages
2. WHEN resource loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior or graceful degradation
3. WHEN exceptions occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN invalid game states are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and attempt recovery
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail safely without corrupting game state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the rendering system, I want optimized and organized rendering code, so that the game performs well and rendering logic is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering occurs THEN only visible elements SHALL be processed
2. WHEN the camera moves THEN the culling system SHALL efficiently determine what to render
3. WHEN multiple render layers exist THEN they SHALL be rendered in the correct order
4. WHEN render resources are managed THEN they SHALL be properly cached and disposed
5. IF rendering performance degrades THEN profiling information SHALL be available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with configuration, I want externalized and validated configuration management, so that game settings can be easily modified and validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration values are accessed THEN they SHALL be validated for correctness
2. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log warnings
3. WHEN configuration needs to be changed THEN it SHALL be possible without recompiling the code
4. WHEN the game starts THEN configuration SHALL be loaded from external files with fallback to defaults
5. IF configuration files are missing or corrupted THEN the game SHALL still start with default values

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working with the input system, I want a flexible and extensible input handling system, so that new input methods and key bindings can be easily added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input events occur THEN they SHALL be processed through a centralized input manager
2. WHEN key bindings need to be changed THEN it SHALL be possible through configuration
3. WHEN multiple input sources exist THEN they SHALL be handled consistently
4. WHEN input commands are processed THEN they SHALL be decoupled from specific key codes
5. IF new input devices need to be supported THEN they SHALL integrate without changing existing code

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working with the collision system, I want an efficient and accurate collision detection system, so that collision checks are fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collision detection occurs THEN it SHALL use spatial partitioning for efficiency
2. WHEN entities move THEN collision checks SHALL only test relevant nearby objects
3. WHEN collision responses are calculated THEN they SHALL be physically accurate
4. WHEN multiple collision types exist THEN they SHALL be handled by appropriate specialized handlers
5. IF collision detection becomes a performance bottleneck THEN optimization tools SHALL be available

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer working with game assets, I want a robust asset management system, so that resources are loaded efficiently and managed properly throughout the game lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be cached to avoid redundant loading
2. WHEN assets are no longer needed THEN they SHALL be properly disposed to free memory
3. WHEN asset loading fails THEN fallback assets SHALL be used and errors logged
4. WHEN the game starts THEN essential assets SHALL be preloaded for smooth gameplay
5. IF memory usage becomes excessive THEN unused assets SHALL be automatically unloaded

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want comprehensive unit tests and documentation, so that code changes can be made confidently and new developers can understand the system quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN core game systems are modified THEN unit tests SHALL verify the changes don't break existing functionality
2. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL include corresponding unit tests
3. WHEN public APIs are created THEN they SHALL have comprehensive documentation
4. WHEN complex algorithms are implemented THEN they SHALL have explanatory comments
5. IF code coverage drops below acceptable levels THEN the build SHALL fail until coverage is restored
